What is HTML?
	HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) is the standard language which with web documents are displayed on browsers. It's used in conjuction with CSS 
	(Cascading Style Sheets) and Javascript to create stylised, interactive web pages.   
	(Also note: HTML5 is the new standard, it is mainly distinguished from previous versions, with it's emphasis on video and audio being integral 
	aspects of the language. This translates to not needing external plugins like Flash to play a video, using the in-built tag <video>.).
