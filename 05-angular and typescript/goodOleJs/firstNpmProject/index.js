/* 
    node    =   runtime environment for javascript. This way we can run
                    js outside the browser. NodeJs is a server side 
                    implementation of js. It comes with npm and 
                    is not the same js as we are used to in the browser.
    npm     =   node package manager. It will do alot for us like installing
                    and managing our dependencies for our project, initializing
                    a new project, running commands and scripts, etc.
node command    we can run a js file or js commands straight from
                    the terminal
npm init        initialize a new js project
                    follow the prompts for it to create a new package.json
package.json    this will list all of your dependencies, scripts that can 
                    be ran, project information; it is essentially the
                    javascript version of the pom.xml.
npm install     installs dependency found on npmjs.com
    -g          globally
npm uninstall   removes a dependency from the project
