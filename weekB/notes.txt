Notes will go in this file for today.

TODOs for the day:
- Exceptions
- Testing
- JUnit
- Map Interface (bonus!)
- Basic Maven

Extras:
- fibonacci
- StringBuilder/StringBuffer

StringBuilder (quick):
If we're building a String in many pieces, we end up using extra memory
"a" + "b" + "c" + "d" + ...
Each String produced "on the way" takes up memory.
A StringBuilder lets us produce a String piece-by-piece more efficiently


Splitting code out into methods:
Up to this point, we've been writing long main methods
this is a bad practice.
Instead, we should be splitting functionality off into methods
our code will be easier to follow and more reusable
if main calls a series of other methods rather
than being a long list of instructions
